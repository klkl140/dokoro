# dokoro
a roboter for playing cards


Idea:
This device should replace a normal player.
It will be possible to play doko without having 4 people at the same table.
The device could act like a normal player, playing with its own intelligence or as an interface for an external player, for example sitting in timbuktu.
In addition it can be used for many different card games. Only a software problem.....

How it should work:
A human player is distributing the cards. The dokoro gets its cards placed in the cardholder.
It starts scanning its cards. For this purpose it has one motor, one servo and a camera. The cards a placed one by one in front of the camera and an image-recognition is used. 

After the cards are recognized the play could start. A camera watches the playfield. This second view might be part of the first camera view using a mirror.
For the intelligence the project FreeDoko will get used. http://free-doko.sourceforge.net/de/FreeDoko.html

other ideas:
A monitor could be used to show informations. When the dokoro is used as an interface this monitor could be used to display the remote player. 

Enjoy it.... Klaus
